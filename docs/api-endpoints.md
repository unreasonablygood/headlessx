# API Endpoints

This document describes the backend HTTP surface for `apps/api` in HeadlessX.

It is based on the operator-first route tree mounted in `apps/api/src/app.ts`.

## Backend System Summary

- Runtime: Express 5 API with TypeScript
- Persistence: PostgreSQL via Prisma
- Auth: `x-api-key` guard on all non-health routes
- Async jobs: BullMQ with Redis and a separate worker process
- Browser scraping: Headfox JS with Camoufox-compatible browser bundles plus Playwright services
- External integrations: Tavily, Exa, yt-engine, HTML-to-Markdown service

## Auth And Transport

- Public route: `GET /api/health`
- Protected routes: every other `/api/*` endpoint requires `x-api-key`, except
  the fixed public-page scrape/evidence paths when called by an admitted
  trusted-seat Tailnet identity.
- Internal dashboard traffic can use `DASHBOARD_INTERNAL_API_KEY`
- SSE endpoints use `text/event-stream`

Common SSE event names in this backend:

- `start`
- `progress`
- `result`
- `error`
- `done`

Google AI Search currently ends its stream with `end` instead of `done`.

## Dependency Notes

| Area | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| `/api/jobs/*` | Redis plus the queue worker |
| `/api/operators/website/crawl` | Redis plus the queue worker |
| `/api/operators/website/scrape/content` | Uses `HTML_TO_MARKDOWN_SERVICE_URL` when available, then falls back locally |
| `/api/operators/google/ai-search/*` | Shared browser profile must be cookie-bootstrapped once before search |
| `/api/operators/tavily/*` | `TAVILY_API_KEY` |
| `/api/operators/exa/*` | `EXA_API_KEY` |
| `/api/operators/youtube/*` | `YT_ENGINE_URL` to activate the yt-engine-backed workspace |
| most protected routes | PostgreSQL for API keys, logs, settings, proxies, and persisted data |

Only the queue-backed website crawl flow requires Redis. The other website operator endpoints such as `/api/operators/website/scrape/html`, `/api/operators/website/scrape/html-js`, `/api/operators/website/scrape/content`, `/api/operators/website/scrape/screenshot`, and `/api/operators/website/map` do not depend on Redis.

## Core Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/health` | Public health check and route summary |
| `ALL` | `/mcp` | Remote MCP endpoint over Streamable HTTP |
| `GET` | `/api/config` | Read current system settings |

| `GET` | `/api/logs` | List paginated request logs |
| `GET` | `/api/logs/stats` | Read aggregated request log stats |
| `GET` | `/api/keys` | List API keys |
| `POST` | `/api/keys` | Create API key |
| `PATCH` | `/api/keys/:id/revoke` | Revoke API key |
| `DELETE` | `/api/keys/:id` | Delete API key |

## Operator Catalog Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/operators/status` | List all playground operators with current availability | Returns active, config-required, offline, and coming-soon operators |

## Proxy Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/proxies` | List all proxies |
| `GET` | `/api/proxies/active` | List active proxies only |
| `GET` | `/api/proxies/:id` | Read one proxy |
| `POST` | `/api/proxies` | Create proxy |
| `PATCH` | `/api/proxies/:id` | Update proxy |
| `DELETE` | `/api/proxies/:id` | Delete proxy |
| `POST` | `/api/proxies/:id/toggle` | Toggle active state |
| `POST` | `/api/proxies/:id/test` | Test proxy connectivity |

## Website Operator Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/api/operators/website/scrape/stream` | SSE website scrape | Primary streaming scrape route |
| `POST` | `/api/operators/website/map` | Discover links quickly | Non-streaming |
| `POST` | `/api/operators/website/map/stream` | Stream site discovery progress | SSE |
| `POST` | `/api/operators/website/crawl` | Queue-backed crawl job | Requires Redis and worker |
| `POST` | `/api/operators/website/scrape/html` | Fast HTML scrape | No JS rendering |
| `POST` | `/api/operators/website/scrape/html-js` | JS-rendered HTML scrape | Browser-rendered |
| `POST` | `/api/operators/website/scrape/content` | Markdown content extraction | Uses markdown service when configured |
| `POST` | `/api/operators/website/scrape/screenshot` | Full-page screenshot | Binary image result |
| `POST` | `/api/operators/website/evidence` | Bounded isolated public evidence capture | Strict `document`, `artifact`, or `element` body; exact bytes, redirect, digest, browser, and timing receipts; refuses authentication targets |
| `GET` | `/api/operators/website/evidence/metrics` | Read evidence capture saturation | Active concurrency and bounded queue depth |

The `element` evidence kind is intentionally narrower than the screenshot API.
It accepts one stable `#id` or `.class` selector and expected public identity,
then uses the same isolated session as the rendered document. The selected DOM
node must be unique, visible, inside the viewport, and bounded to 800 by 320
pixels, 160,000 pixels of area, and 30 percent of the viewport. It must contain
exactly one image, inline SVG, or CSS background image plus visible authored
identity text. Hidden regions, canvas/video/iframe, product/gallery/partner
contexts, multi-image strips, and identity mismatches are refused. The response
includes the PNG, bounds, viewport, primitive and identity evidence, stable
description, screenshot digest, and the ordinary parent document evidence.

## Google AI Search Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/api/operators/google/ai-search/search` | Standard Google AI Search scrape | JSON response, accepts `query` plus optional `gl`, `hl`, `tbs`, and `stealth` |
| `GET` | `/api/operators/google/ai-search/stream` | Stream Google AI Search progress | SSE, expects `query` and optional `timeout`, `gl`, `hl`, `tbs`, and `stealth` |
| `GET` | `/api/operators/google/ai-search/status` | Service status | Lightweight availability check |
| `GET` | `/api/operators/google/ai-search/cookies/status` | Read shared-profile cookie bootstrap state | Returns `required`, `running`, or `ready` |
| `POST` | `/api/operators/google/ai-search/cookies/build` | Start the shared browser for manual Google cookie setup | Opens Google in the shared profile, uses a virtual display when needed |
| `POST` | `/api/operators/google/ai-search/cookies/stop` | Stop the shared cookie bootstrap browser and persist the profile | Saves the shared session for later searches |

Google AI Search request fields:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `query` | `string` | Search query text |
| `gl` | `string` | Two-letter Google region code such as `pk`, `us`, or `in` |
| `hl` | `string` | Two-letter Google language code such as `en` or `ur` |
| `tbs` | `qdr:h \\| qdr:d \\| qdr:w` | Optional time filter for past hour, day, or week |
| `stealth` | `boolean` | Optional stealth toggle, where `false` uses a faster less-humanized input path |

Google bootstrap behavior:

- before the shared profile is ready, search endpoints return `412` with code `GOOGLE_COOKIE_BOOTSTRAP_REQUIRED`
- while the cookie browser is still open, search endpoints return `409` with code `GOOGLE_COOKIE_BOOTSTRAP_ACTIVE`
- the shared profile is persisted under `apps/api/data/browser-profile/default` for local repo runs and in the Docker `browser_profile` volume for self-hosted stacks

| `POST` | `/api/jobs/:id/cancel` | Cancel running or queued job | Uses active job manager / queue cancellation |

## Operational Notes

- The API and worker are separate processes. Queue-backed endpoints may return `503` when Redis is unavailable.
- Configuration changes invalidate cached settings and restart the browser service.
- Website Crawl is not an inline scrape. It is the only website operator workflow here that is queue-backed.
- The web dashboard talks to this API using the internal dashboard key on server-side requests.
- The MCP endpoint uses normal API keys created from the dashboard and does not accept `DASHBOARD_INTERNAL_API_KEY`.
