## Overview

HeadlessX is a self-hosted scraping platform with a web dashboard, protected API, queue-backed workflows, and a remote MCP endpoint.

Current live operator surfaces:

- Website operator: scrape, crawl, map, content extraction, screenshots
- Google AI Search
- Tavily
- Exa
- YouTube
- Queue jobs, logs, API keys, proxy management, and config management
- Remote MCP over `/mcp`

Important operator setup notes:

- Google AI Search requires a one-time `Build Cookies` run in the dashboard before the first search
- the saved Google session is kept in the shared persistent browser profile and reused later
- the YouTube workspace is active only when `YT_ENGINE_URL` points at a healthy `yt-engine` service

## What Changed In v2.1.2

- Added the published HeadlessX CLI bootstrap flow with `headlessx init`, `start`, `logs`, `stop`, `restart`, `status`, and `doctor`
- Upgraded the CLI prompt UX with guided modern setup and login prompts
- Added Docker plus Caddy production domain scaffolding under `infra/domain-setup`
- Moved local and Docker host defaults to rarer ports to avoid conflicts with common `3000` and `8000` stacks
- Refreshed setup, CLI, and self-hosting docs around the current operator-first platform layout

## Agent Skills

You can add the HeadlessX CLI skill to AI coding agents such as Cursor, Claude Code, Warp, Windsurf, OpenCode, OpenClaw, Antigravity, and similar tools that support the `skills` installer flow.

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/saifyxpro/HeadlessX --skill cli
```

This installs the HeadlessX CLI skill from this repository so the agent can use the published `headlessx` command and follow the packaged usage guidance.

## Quick Start

### System Requirements

| Item | Minimum | Recommended |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OS | macOS, Linux, or Windows 11 with WSL2 | Ubuntu 22.04+/24.04, Debian 12, or Windows 11 with WSL2 |
| CPU | 2 cores | 4+ cores |
| RAM | 4 GB | 8-16 GB |
| Disk | 10 GB free | 20+ GB SSD |
| Network | outbound internet for installs, browser downloads, and APIs | stable broadband |

### Runtime Dependencies

- Node.js 22+
- pnpm 10.32.1+
- Git
- Docker + Compose v2 for self-host or production mode
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Python/uv for `yt-engine`
- Go for the HTML-to-Markdown sidecar

If your machine does not already use the pinned pnpm release, align it with:

```bash
corepack enable
corepack use pnpm@10.32.1
```

### Practical Sizing Notes

- 4 GB RAM is enough for light local testing
- 8 GB RAM is the better baseline for the web, API, worker, Redis, and browser runtime together
- 16 GB RAM is safer for heavier crawl jobs, YouTube flows, or multiple concurrent browser tasks

### CLI Bootstrap

HeadlessX is now CLI-first for installation and local lifecycle management.

```bash
npm install -g @headlessx-cli/core
headlessx init
headlessx status
headlessx doctor
```

The CLI bootstraps HeadlessX into `~/.headlessx` by default and supports three setup modes:

- `developer`: clone the repo, keep app services local, and use Docker only where needed for infrastructure
- `self-host`: run the full HeadlessX stack on rare localhost ports with Docker
- `production`: run the Docker app stack plus the Caddy/domain layer for `dashboard.yourdomain.com` and `api.yourdomain.com`

Useful examples:

```bash
headlessx init --mode developer
headlessx init --mode self-host
headlessx init --mode production --api-domain api.example.com --web-domain dashboard.example.com --caddy-email ops@example.com
headlessx init update
headlessx init update --branch develop
headlessx start
headlessx logs
headlessx restart
headlessx stop
```

For existing VPS or Docker installs, use `headlessx init update` to pull the latest repo state into `~/.headlessx/repo`, reconcile missing env keys for the saved mode, then run `headlessx restart`.
For `self-host` and `production`, `headlessx restart` rebuilds Docker images before bringing the stack back up.

HeadlessX intentionally uses uncommon localhost defaults to avoid conflicts with other tools:
`web=34872`, `api=38473`, `postgres=35432`, `redis=36379`, `html-to-md=38081`, `yt-engine=38090`.

For deeper setup details, direct repo development, env files, Docker internals, and MCP/client notes, see [docs/setup-guide.md](docs/setup-guide.md).

### Google AI Search First Run

The first Google AI Search run now uses a shared persistent browser profile instead of a seeded browser profile committed into the repo.

1. Open `/playground/operators/google/ai-search`
2. Click `Build Cookies`
3. Let the shared browser open Google
4. Browse normally and solve any Google or reCAPTCHA prompt once
5. Click `Stop Browser` to save the profile

After that, the saved shared profile is reused for later Google searches.

- Docker and VPS installs persist it in the `browser_profile` volume
- local repo runs persist it under `apps/api/data/browser-profile/default`
- the old tracked `apps/api/default-data/browser-profile` bundle has been removed

### YouTube Workspace

The YouTube operator is live only when `YT_ENGINE_URL` is configured.

- CLI `self-host` and `production` init flows write it automatically
- custom local setups must point `YT_ENGINE_URL` at a reachable `yt-engine` instance

## API Summary

All non-health backend routes are protected with `x-api-key`.

Core backend surfaces:

- `GET /api/health`
- `GET/PATCH /api/config`
- `GET /api/dashboard/stats`
- `GET /api/logs`
- `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/keys`
- proxy CRUD under `/api/proxies`
- website operator routes under `/api/operators/website/*`
- Google AI Search routes under `/api/operators/google/ai-search/*`
- Tavily routes under `/api/operators/tavily/*`
- Exa routes under `/api/operators/exa/*`
- YouTube routes under `/api/operators/youtube/*`
- queue job routes under `/api/jobs/*`
- remote MCP endpoint at `/mcp`

See the full route reference in [docs/api-endpoints.md](docs/api-endpoints.md).

## MCP

HeadlessX exposes a remote MCP endpoint from the API:

```text
http://localhost:38473/mcp
```

Use a normal API key created from the dashboard API Keys page.

Do not use `DASHBOARD_INTERNAL_API_KEY` for MCP clients.

Example client config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "headlessx": {
      "transport": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:38473/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "x-api-key": "hx_your_dashboard_created_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Monorepo Layout

  api/                    Express API + worker + MCP

## Notes

- The dashboard uses the internal dashboard key for server-side internal requests
- MCP uses normal user-created API keys, not the dashboard internal key
- Queue-backed features return degraded/unavailable behavior when Redis is missing
- Docker support now covers the full runtime stack, including yt-engine
